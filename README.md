Word Viz Test
=============

```
npm install
npm run watch-js
```

Then open `index.html` from the file system.

## TODO

 - [X] Easing methods / Timing (for line drawing)
 - [X] Order of fade (Words should fade first)
 - [X] Drawing a map onto canvas
 - [ ] Visualization starts by showing circles from all over the world, fading in and out
 - [X] Add start/stop
 - [ ] Fix drawing so it doesn't duplicate lines and make colors darker (or clear after every frame?)
 - [ ] Clean up styling in JS/CSS
 - [ ] Refactor textBg box

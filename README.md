Word Viz Test
=============

```
npm install
npm run watch-js
```

Then open `index.html` from the file system.

## TODO

 - [X] Easing methods / Timing (for line drawing)
 - [X] Order of fade (Words should fade first)
 - [X] Drawing a map onto canvas
 - [ ] Visualization starts by showing circles from all over the world, fading in and out
 - [X] Add start/stop
 - [ ] Fix drawing so it doesn't duplicate lines and make colors darker (or clear after every frame?)
 - [ ] Clean up styling in JS/CSS
 - [ ] Refactor textBg box
 - [ ] Fix map width:height ratio
 - [ ] Link up lines to draw a couple long lines instead of thousands?
 - [ ] draw with GPU? (poor performance on ARM - raspberry pi??)
 - [ ] pan / zoom map to specific country / region?
 - [ ] position captions by quadrant
 - [ ] create other scenes (haikus, etc)
 - [ ] draw individual countries (draw one country at a time?)
